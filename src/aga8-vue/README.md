## About AGA8

The AGA8 Detail method is used for calculating the compressibility factor of natural gas mixtures. This project leverages WebAssembly to bind the AGA8 code for efficient computation in the browser.

## Usage

This demo allows users to input gas composition and other parameters to compute the compressibility factor using the AGA8 Detail method.
