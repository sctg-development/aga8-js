# AGA8 Vue Demo

This project is a Vue.js website that demonstrates the DETAIL computation using the main WebAssembly binding of the AGA8 code.

A working demo is available at [Lasersmart AGA8](https://aga8.lasersmart.work/) all computations are done in the browser.

## About AGA8

The AGA8 Detail method is used for calculating the compressibility factor of natural gas mixtures. This project leverages WebAssembly to bind the AGA8 code for efficient computation in the browser.

## Usage

This demo allows users to input gas composition and other parameters to compute the compressibility factor using the AGA8 Detail method.
